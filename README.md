# SkillsTracker2
I have recently been studying the Microsoft technology stack using Microsoft's online documentation.  I really like 
the Microsoft online documentation and the various "Paths", "Skills" etc.  However, it is fairly vast and 
deep, and keeping track of where I am with various skills is an issue.  I thought it would be nice to have a more 
linear way to keep track of where I was in skills development and I needed a programming exercise where I could 
practice with all of hte various skills and technologies.  SO I created this project to keep track of skills 
and the skill level of developers with each skill.

## Summary
SkillsTracker has 3 projects.
	1. The .net Framework asp.net MVC application for the user interface.  I really wanted to use a database first approach and found 
out the hard way that .net core only supports a code first approach.  So I switched to .net framework.
	2. The MSTest project for automated tests.  I strongly believe in automated tests and think that it should be part of the 
process from the beginning, not a bolt on after the fact when quality is already low.
	3. The database project.  This is fantastic, I really like it.  The SQL Server Management Studio interface in Visual Studio 
community edition, need I say more?

## Vision
I envision this project to facillitate keeping track of a complex set of interrelated technologies and related skills.  The Microsoft
documentation online will keep track of the exercises you've completed, but I want a hierarchy may to get a better sense for where 
I am and where I need to focus.  Enable the tracking of developers to skills with a skill level.  It also keeps track of skill
relationships and stores links to each skill.  Later I'll add reports.
